## What is SemanticHuman-HD?
The main contributions of our human image systhesis model are listed as followed:
1. The first method to synthesize **semantic disentangled full-body** human image.
2. We propose a **3D-aware super-resolution module** which enable our project achieve 3D-aware image synthesis at $1024^2$ resolution.
